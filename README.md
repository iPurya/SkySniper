# SkySniper ✈️

> Find the Cheapest Flights, Automatically.

SkySniper is a smart flight scraping and monitoring tool designed to help travelers save money. Unlike standard search engines, SkySniper works for you 24/7. It aggregates flight data from multiple booking platforms, compares prices, and identifies the most cost-effective options.

## 🎯 Key Value Proposition

The core feature of SkySniper is its **"Last-Minute Drop"** detection. It continuously polls flight data up until the departure time. If a seat price drops due to last-minute cancellations or airline algorithm changes, SkySniper instantly notifies you, ensuring you never miss a deal.

## ✨ Features

- 🔔 **Real-Time Price Alerts**: Monitors specific routes and notifies users (via Telegram/Email) the moment a price drops below the previous low
